# MSR-VTT-DataCleaning

We found MSR-VTT dataset contains a lot of noisy samples. 
After analyzing the data carefully, we put some effort on cleaning the dataset. 
We retrained some models on the cleaned dataset and found experimental results improved on the old test set. 
The new model of VNS-GRU achieves better results than any other models on all the metrics.
